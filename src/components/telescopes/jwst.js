              Webb will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving
              thousands of astronomers worldwide. It will study every phase in
              the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows
              after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of
              supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own
              Solar System.

              Webb will work simultaneously with Hubble until its mission ends
              and the JWST replaces it.
